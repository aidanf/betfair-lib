Betfair Non-Runner Rule applies. This market will turn IN PLAY at the off with unmatched bets (with the exception of bets for which the \"keep\" option has been selected) cancelled once the Betfair SP reconciliation process has been completed. Betting will be suspended at the end of the race. Should a Photo, Stewards Enquiry or Objection be called the market may be re-opened with unmatched bets (again with the exception of bets for which the \"keep\" option has been selected) cancelled. The market will then be suspended when this result is announced. This market will initially be settled on a First Past the Post basis. However we will re-settle all bets should the official result at the time of the \"weigh-in\" announcement differ from any initial settlement. BETS ARE PLACED ON A NAMED HORSE. Dead Heat rules apply.<br><br>Customers should be aware that:<b><ol><li>transmissions described as \"live\" by some broadcasters may actually be delayed;<\/li><li>the extent of any such delay may vary, depending on the set-up through which they are receiving pictures or data;<\/b> and <\/li><li>information (such as jockey silks, saddlecloth numbers etc) is provided \"as is\" and is for guidance only.
